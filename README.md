# AuroraDB — A Minimal Key–Value Storage Engine in C++

AuroraDB is a **learning-focused key–value storage engine** written in C++, built to understand **how databases work from the inside**, starting from first principles.
 
The goal is **clarity, correctness, and core systems knowledge**.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

> Build a small, correct, persistent key–value storage engine and understand every part of it.

This is **not** a production database.
This is a **systems project** to learn:
- storage engines
- indexing
- persistence
- caching
- OS-level constraints
